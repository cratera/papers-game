Here's a list of my learnings while building this mobile game with reac-native.

- My best friends for this new journey: [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs), [react-navigation docs](https://reactnavigation.org/) and [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)

# React Native

- Diff between native ScrollView and react-native-gesture-handler. The 2nd is replacment improved.

# Expo

- [Remove React Navigation 5.x warnings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60212460/how-to-remove-reach-navigation-5-x-warnings)
- üêõ Had to transform a Fn component to a Class, so TextInput would work properly. (HomeSignup). Back in a function component, on each onChangeText, the TextInput would unmount/mount, causing the keyboard to close (and re-open if autoFocus).... have no idea why. Google didn't help :(
- IOS: shadow doesn't work on elements with overflow:hidden (border-radius). ex: Button.
- Upload files to Firebase was a nightmare. See `store/Firebase.js _uploadAvatar()` for more info.
