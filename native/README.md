# Papers Game (Native)

In development... come back next month.

## Run the Game locally:

Make sure a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed. You'll also need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install). With those 2 things you are ready to go!

- Clone the project and navigate to this folder:

```bash
cd /native
```

- Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn # or npm install
```

- Start the project in dev:

```bash
yarn start # or npm run start
```

A new webpage on the browser will be opened with a QR CODE.

- **Play on the browser**: Click "Run in Web Browser"
- **Play on the Phone**: Install [Expo Client](https://expo.io/tools#client) and take a photo of the QR code.
